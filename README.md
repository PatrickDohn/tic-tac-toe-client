TIC TAC TOE:
This application allows the user to play tic tac toe against themselves or a friend. While also being able to sign in and out.

Planning Story:
This is my very first front end application, I took a lot of time firguring out the planning and where to start. First I started with a wireframe to give me a visual for how I wanted the application to look from there I tried to organize what parts of the app would be most difficult for me. I figured starting with the most difficult issues first would give all the time i needed to get those problems solved. For me that was the game logic and communicating with the API. Once I got those sorted out thats when I started the styling aspect. I tried to commit after every working session of the project as to not lose any progress.
